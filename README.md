# Food and Nutrition Analysis using Kaggle Dataset

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing food and nutrition data using a dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to uncover nutritional trends, compare different food categories, and visualize essential insights.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, formatting data, and standardizing units.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizing key nutritional information.
- **Nutritional Comparisons**: Analyzing macronutrients and micronutrients across different food types.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating charts and graphs for better insight.
- **Caloric & Health Insights**: Understanding calorie distribution and health impact.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
- Kaggle Dataset
- Excel (Optional for manual exploration)

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Food Name**: Name of the food item
- **Category**: Type of food (Fruits, Vegetables, Fast Food, etc.)
- **Calories**: Energy content per serving
- **Macronutrients**: Protein, Fat, Carbohydrates, Fiber
- **Micronutrients**: Vitamins and Minerals
- **Serving Size**: Standard portion measurement

## Steps to Perform Analysis
1. **Download the Dataset** from Kaggle.
2. **Load and Explore Data**
   - Read the dataset using Pandas.
   - Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
3. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Standardize units (grams, milligrams, kilocalories, etc.).
   - Remove duplicates and clean column names.
4. **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Generate summary statistics.
   - Analyze trends in calories and nutrients.
5. **Data Visualization**
   - Create bar charts, pie charts, and scatter plots.
   - Compare food categories based on nutritional value.
6. **Insights and Findings**
   - Identify the healthiest food options.
   - Compare fast food vs. home-cooked meals.
   - Examine the impact of sugar and fat intake.

## Expected Outcomes
- Clear insights into the nutritional composition of various foods.
- Visual representation of calorie and nutrient distribution.
- Health-conscious recommendations based on data.

## How to Use
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab script.
3. Follow the analysis steps to explore data and generate insights.
4. Customize the analysis based on your requirements.

## Conclusion
This project helps in understanding food nutrition data through data science techniques. It enables better food choices and promotes healthier eating habits based on real-world data.
